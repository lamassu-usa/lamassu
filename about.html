          <p>
            Lamassu General Trading LLC is a U.S.-registered supplier headquartered in Manteca,
            California. Our leadership team has supported multiple DoD and DoS contracts across
            Iraq and Afghanistan between 2003 and 2023, supplying a wide range of products for
            U.S. military bases, logistics hubs, and infrastructure projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building on this proven international track record, Lamassu has expanded its U.S.
            operations to strengthen domestic government contracting and private-sector
            partnerships, with a focus on reliability, compliance, and responsiveness.
